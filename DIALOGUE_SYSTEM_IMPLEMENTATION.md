## 📝 **Dialogue Content (Option B)**

**15 exchanges** between Dr. Yan and Alara covering:

✅ Neural link and fragment technology  
✅ What the echo/fragment is  
✅ **Anomalies explained** (trauma manifestations)  
✅ **Zombies** (how they appear and behave)  
✅ **Combat** (weapons available, need to fight)  
✅ **Danger** (psychological harm possible)  
✅ **Mission** (find the memory, break the loop)  
✅ **Stakes** (getting lost in the echo)

**Total Duration**: ~35 seconds (auto-advancing)  
**Skippable**: Yes (press E anytime)

---

## 🆕 **New Files Created**

### `src/ui/DialogueScreen.tsx`

Complete dialogue system with:

- Auto-advancing text (3-4 sec per line)
- Speaker identification (Dr. Yan vs Alara)
- Color-coded speakers (cyan for Dr. Yan, blue for Alara)
- **Red text highlight** when "anomalies" are mentioned
- Fade in/out transitions
- Progress bar showing current position
- "Press E to Skip" indicator
- Tracks dialogue state

---

## 🔄 **Updated Files**

### `src/ui/CutsceneManager.tsx`

**New Functions:**

- `startDialogueSequence()` - Triggers after "Press E to Start"
- `handleSkipDialogue()` - Skips dialogue when E pressed
- `isDialogueActive()` - Checks if dialogue is showing
- `resetDialogue()` - Resets for replay

**New Flow:**

- Intro → Start Menu → **Dialogue** → Game
- Proper state management
- Skip functionality

### `src/systems/GameStateSystem.ts`

**Updated E Key Handling:**

- Now checks if dialogue is active
- Triggers dialogue sequence instead of going straight to game
- Skip dialogue if E pressed during dialogue
- Cleaner input handling

---

## 🎨 **Visual Design**

### **Dialogue Screen Appearance:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│                                         │
│             DR. YAN                     │ ← Cyan, small caps
│                                         │
│   "Neural link established.             │ ← White, large
│    Fragment Seven is loaded             │
│    and stable."                         │
│                                         │
│                                         │
│         [Press E to Skip]               │ ← Bottom right, gray
│                                         │
│    [=================─────]             │ ← Progress bar
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Styling:**

- Pure black background
- Speaker name above dialogue
- Dr. Yan = **Cyan** color
- Alara = **Blue** color
- "Anomalies" keyword = **Red** tint (danger)
- Smooth fade transitions between lines
- Progress bar at bottom

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### **Auto-Advance Timing:**

Each line displays for a specific duration:

- Short lines: 2.5-3 seconds
- Medium lines: 3-4 seconds
- Long lines: 4-4.5 seconds

Total: ~35 seconds for full conversation

### **Skip Functionality:**

- Press **E** at any time during dialogue
- Immediately completes dialogue
- Proceeds to game start
- State tracked to not show again

### **State Management:**

```typescript
dialogueShown = false // Tracks if shown this session
isShowingDialogue = false // Currently active
currentLineIndex = 0 // Which line is displaying
lineStartTime = 0 // When current line started
```

---

## 🔊 **Audio Recommendations** (Future Enhancement)

You can add these audio elements:

### **Voice Acting:**

- Dr. Yan: Calm, professional male voice
- Alara: Young, nervous female voice
- Record each line separately
- Sync with text timing

### **Sound Effects:**

- Dialogue text appear: Soft "beep" or "type" sound
- Line transitions: Subtle "whoosh"
- "Anomalies" mentioned: Distant zombie growl
- Skip action: Quick "swoosh" sound

### **Ambient Music:**

- Low tension drone during dialogue
- Builds slightly when zombies mentioned
- Fades out as game starts

---

## 🎮 **Integration Notes**

### **Placeholder for Future:**

Line 96 in `CutsceneManager.tsx` has a TODO:

```typescript
// TODO: Play 7-second entry cutscene here
// For now, go straight to game
```

When you add the 7-second entry video:

1. Place video file in `videos/` folder (e.g., `entry-fragment.mp4`)
2. Create similar video player to intro
3. Play after dialogue completes
4. Then call `startGame()`

### **Testing:**

- Dialogue shows after pressing E on start menu
- Each line auto-advances correctly
- Pressing E during dialogue skips to game
- Dialogue only shows once per session
- Can reset with `resetCutscene()` function

---

## 📊 **Statistics**

**Code Added:**

- DialogueScreen.tsx: ~200 lines
- CutsceneManager updates: ~80 lines
- GameStateSystem updates: ~15 lines

**Features:**

- 15 dialogue exchanges
- Auto-advance system
- Skip functionality
- Fade animations
- Progress tracking
- Color-coded speakers
- Red danger highlights

**No Errors:** ✅ All linting passed

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Optional):**

1. **Test the dialogue** - Run the game and see the flow
2. **Adjust timings** - If lines feel too fast/slow
3. **Tweak colors** - Speaker colors can be changed in DialogueScreen.tsx

### **Future Enhancements:**

1. **Add voice acting** - Record and sync audio files
2. **Create 7-second entry video** - Use the prompt provided
3. **Add sound effects** - Ambient sounds, transition whooshes
4. **Multiple dialogue paths** - Different conversations on replay
5. **Collectible memory fragments** - Mid-game story moments
6. **Between-wave cinematics** - Story progression during gameplay
7. **Ending sequence** - Victory cutscene when escaping the echo

## 🎬 **Video Prompt Reminder**

When you're ready for the 7-second entry video:

```
POV: Medical ceiling, bright lights, doctor's face. Violent glitch
transition. Rush through tunnel of memory fragments - street, buildings,
shadowy zombie figures watching. Burst of light. Standing in foggy
street at dusk, look down at feet then up at empty neighborhood.
Horror cinematic, desaturated, 7 seconds, 4K.
```

---

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE & READY TO TEST!**

The dialogue system is fully integrated and waiting for your video assets. The game flow now properly introduces the story before gameplay begins!
